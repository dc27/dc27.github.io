      <h3>Builder's Quantities</h3>
      <b>For a limited period </b>, we are able to provide builder's quantities for projects based on:
      <ul>
      <li>0.12% for projects over £10m</li>
      <li>0.15% for new build projects between £8m and £10m</li>
      <li>0.18% for new build projects between £5m and £8m</li>
      <li>0.20% for new build projects between £3m and £5m</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Refurbishment projects, those with sectional completion and smaller projects are subject to agreement of a competitive fee.</p>
      <p>All values are exclusive of VAT, which will be charged at the prevailing rate</p>
      <p>Builders’ quantities can be produced on CATO or excel exported files (or your own bespoke system where possible.)</p>
      <p>Builder’s quantities normally excludes both Services and Structural frame; but these can be incorporated at an agreed additional fee, if required</p>
      <p>For calculation of fee the gross total value of the project is used. Repeat works can be considered separately for an agreed discount.</p>
      <p>The values are based on the estimator providing drawings based on pdf or dwg with a specification provided on word or similar document.</p>
      <p>This offer may be withdrawn without notice and is subject to agreement of terms and conditions including duration and phasing of information.</p>
